   Application can request its window to be moved or reshaped by changing its x/y and or width/height
   the window will be reshaped and moved in the next possible event dispatch looop.

   All application callbacks are called on event dispatch thread.
   
   On Mac OSX for full screen window mode paint() is called on display connection link thread
   (unless I can try and succeed to channel it to dispatch thread).
 
   input() will be called with decoded UNICODE or ASCII ch != 0, undecoded UNICODE-32 key, and
   combination of flags INPUT_SHIFT ... flags
 
   input() will be called mouse or touch-device x, y absolute screen coordinates and
   possible z proximity or pressure for touch sensors in hover over mode.
 
   input() will be called mouse buttons up and down with .button indicating the button 
   pressed see: INPUT_MOUSE_LEFT_BUTTON ...
   for touch device event.button will contain finger number touched down.
 
   timer() is called periodically if frequency > 0. timer with resolution > 1000Hz are not guaranteed by modern OSes.

   shape() is called when window is moved or resized by user, window manager (e.g. minimize all 
   or snap to top and bottom Windows) or by application request. Durring the shape() call the
   application state still has previous x, y, width, height.
   shape() is also called if window visibility changes (e.g. hidden)
 
   prefs() is called when user or system invokes Preferences or Settings action for the application.
   it is up to application to maintain 'prefs'-state till user exits it and paint visuals accordingly.
 
   if any of the aforementioned functions are null - they are not called at all.

   redraw() may be called by application to invalidate particular region in application coordinates.
